## Game planning
+ Create an array, with three elements: Rock, Paper, Scissors
+ Player A and Player B choose a random element from the array respectively
+ Comparing the elements that Player A and Player B chose to pick the winner 
+ The rule is: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock
+ if Player A and Player B chose the same thing, they tie


## Outside resources
I use the Rock, Paper, Scissors game idea/example from the [E-2 course website](https://hesweb.dev/e2/projects/1).
